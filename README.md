# Zomato Restaurants Data Analysis
**A comprehensive analysis of the Zomato Restaurants dataset.** 

This dataset offers a glimpse into the vast and varied world of restaurants listed on Zomato. The project aims to transform the raw JSON dataset into a structured format suitable for in-depth analysis using a SQL database. I intend to explore several facets of the dataset, such as restaurant ratings, popularity based on cuisine, geographical distribution, price ranges etc. and more as the project proceeds.
